Very small raw protobuf parser.

This is similar to [rawproto](https://github.com/konsumer/rawproto), but without anything around the schema-def.

Use this if you want a really light library, and don't need to generate the schema for some raw protobuf messages, or anything like that. It's fast & light. It has 0-dependencies, and can be used in just about any place that runs javascript (browser, nodejs, cloudflare-edge, deno, bun, etc.)
